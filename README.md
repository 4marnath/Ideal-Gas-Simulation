# Ideal-Gas-Simulation

This a simple 2D simulation of an ideal gas system which shows the expected and actual values of different quantities of a gaseous system such as average velocity and pressure.

The gas constant is set to 0.00831 and the mass of each particle and volume of the system are both set to 1. This simulation gives a qualitiative idea of the behaviour of an ideal gas especially under the influence of gravity.

We can input the temperature and watch the particles moving with the corresponding velocities. The effect of gravity can also be observed which causes deviations from the expected values.

The executable file can only be run on Windows.
