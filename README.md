# Ideal-Gas-Simulation

This a simple 2D simulation of an ideal gas system which shows the expected and actual values of different quantities of a gaseous system such as average velocity and pressure. 
The gas constant is set to 0.00831 and the mass of each particle and volume of the system are both set to 1. 

The executable can only be run on Windows.
